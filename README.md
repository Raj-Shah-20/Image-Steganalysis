# Image-Steganalysis
This project aims to understand and detect hidden messages in digital images, or to predict the likelihood that an image contains secret data.

This Project is part of Course: **CS 577** (Deep Learning)

The Source Code includes the following files:
1. Image Steganalysis - includes the implementation for all the data extraction, and transformation + the training and evaluation.
2. The EDA Analysis for the images.

Because of GPU requirements, all of the Python notebooks in the source code were run on Google Colab. 

Collaborators

1. **Raj Shah**: Responsible for the EDA and tuning the hyperparameters for efficientNet as well as InceptionResNet.
2. **Rutvik Savaliya**: Responsible for the data extraction, augmentation, and transformation of the SRNet model.
3. **Aditya Sharma**: Responsible for the hyperparameter tuning for the model: MobileNet along with documentation.
